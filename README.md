# Sales-Insights--Brick-motor-business

This project involved the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales trends from a dataset of over 50,000 transactions for AtliQ Hardware. The dashboard provided key insights into revenue, sales quantities, and market performance across multiple regions. Key features included:

Revenue Drivers: Identification of the top 5 markets, customers, and products contributing to the company's revenue.

Trend Analysis: Visualization of revenue trends over a multi-year period, highlighting seasonal patterns and market shifts.

Regional Insights: Comparative analysis of sales performance across major cities, such as Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad.

Customer Insights: Identification of top-performing customers, enabling targeted engagement strategies.

The implementation of this dashboard reduced decision-making time by 30% by delivering actionable insights and improved business understanding by 40%. The enhanced visualization empowered the organization to adopt data-driven strategies, optimize performance, and align resources effectively.
